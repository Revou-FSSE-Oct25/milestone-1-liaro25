            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Since 2020, I’ve been building a new chapter of life in Tokyo
              after relocating with my husband. As a mother of three — one
              autistic boy, one very chatty little girl, and one super active
              toddler — my days are a blend of parenting, learning, and
              rediscovering myself both personally and professionally.
            </p>

            <p>
              I bring <strong>10+ years of experience</strong> in the Mobile
              Telecommunications industry, covering full end-to-end application
              planning — from receiving hardware and installing software, to
              testing with the hardware division, and preparing applications for
              customer delivery. My work with Telkomsel, Indosat, Axis, XL, and
              HCPT helped build my foundation in system design, troubleshooting,
              and cross-functional collaboration.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, my love for exploring halal food leads my work with
              <strong>Halal Gourmet Japan</strong>, where I discover
              halal-friendly eateries, create content, and share insights to
              support Muslim residents and travelers in Japan.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also joined <strong>Hello World Japan</strong>, taking part in
              English-based quest games as an Indonesian living in Japan,
              helping Japanese children learn English while introducing
              Indonesian culture. In addition, I teach weekly private Indonesian
              lessons to a child from an Indonesian–French family living in
              Tokyo.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m currently expanding my skills through
              <strong>RevoU’s Full-Stack Software Engineering</strong> program
              while continuing my steady Japanese-learning journey — one day and
              one chapter at a time.
            </p>

            <p>
              My goal is to blend my
              <strong
                >technical background, multicultural experiences, communication
                skills,</strong
              >
              and my well-honed <strong>management abilities</strong> (because
              raising three kids in Japan is real project management!) to create
              meaningful, user-friendly solutions that support diverse
              communities.
